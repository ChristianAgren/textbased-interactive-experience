                            You wake up. Something's wrong but you can't put your finger on what.<br>
                            "...What happened..?" <br>
                            You try and remember any details from earlier, but you can't even recall what day it is. 
                            You start feeling a piercing sensation in your head, like someone driving a nail through your head.
                            For every passing attempt to remember a blow is struck to the nail, increasing the intensity of the pain; forcing you to stop trying to remember... and to start focusing elsewhere.<br>
                            <br>
                            The room surrounding you is dark and damp. You're alone. In front of you is a chest and a note. <br>
                            <br>
                            "Find the clues, find the antidote... or die" <br>
                            <br>
                            The note seems almost like it's taunting you, childishly, but you can feel your heart sink to your stomach either way.
                            Whoever wrote this note is serious.

                    <p>
                            The headache is starting to fall off, thankfully. <br>
                            <br>
                            You're finally coming to your senses. <br>
                            <br>
                            You examine the note that your perpetrator left you but unfortunately there are no other clues. The paper crumples in your hand as you tell yourself that you will find the one responsible for this. <br>
                            Maybe they're still here? I should be able to have my revenge with this axe... <br>
                            ...but first you need to focus on yourself. <br>
                            <br>
                            The door was locked wasn't it? Maybe I should try my hand, and this axe, at it.

                    <p>
                            Carefully and wearily, make your way up the stairs and through the dimly lit hallway. <br>
                            <br>
                            You're finally out of that godforsaken basement, and just in time at that. You could've sworn you saw the walls closing in for a minute. Hopefully you won't need to go back there soon. <br>
                            <br>

                            The living room is well lit with living candles here and there, which is a nice change from the previous rooms. <br>
                            It's time to explore your options. <br>
