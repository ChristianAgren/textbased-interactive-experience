                            You wake up. Something's wrong but you can't put your finger on what.<br>
                            "...What happened..?" <br>
                            You try and remember any details from earlier, but you can't even recall what day it is. 
                            You start feeling a piercing sensation in your head, like someone driving a nail through your head.
                            For every passing attempt to remember a blow is struck to the nail, increasing the intensity of the pain; forcing you to stop trying to remember... and to start focusing elsewhere.<br>
                            <br>
                            The room surrounding you is dark and damp. You're alone and stuck. In front of you is a chest and a note. <br>
                            <br>
                            "Find the clues, find the antidote... or die" <br>
                            <br>
                            The note seems almost like it's taunting you, childishly, but you can feel your heart sink to your stomach either way.
                            Whoever wrote this note is serious. <br>
                            
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase-one">
                    <p>
                            The headache is starting to fall off, thankfully. <br>
                            <br>
                            You're finally coming to your senses. <br>
                            <br>
                            You examine the note that your perpetrator left you but unfortunately there are no other clues. The paper crumples in your hand as you tell yourself that you will find the one responsible for this. <br>
                            Maybe they're still here? I should be able to have my revenge with this axe... <br>
                            ...But first you need to focus on yourself. <br>
                            <br>
                            It feels like you've tried everything in this room. <br>
                            <br>
                            The door was locked wasn't it? Maybe I should try my hand, and this axe, at it.

                            The living room is well lit with living candles here and there, which is a nice change from the previous rooms. <br>
                            From the looks of things it's a very old house you're in. <br>
                            The walls are old and worn, in a dark maroon color. <br>
                            There are some chairs and tables which are covered in tattered white cloth, which means that the building must be abandoned. <br>
                            <br>
                            ...So why are some of the candles lit?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase-three">

                            The library is eerily empty, you're not used to seeing empty bookshelves. <br>
                            There are some books here and there - probably left behind by their previous owner. <br>
                            <br>
                            Some of the items in the room catches your attention. The note said "clues" right? Maybe there's something hidden behind one of the bookshelves? <br>
                            Wouldn't that be generic?
                    </p>

                            That stairway up here will not last long... I should be careful with it or I might be done for before I can get to the antidote. <br>
                            <br>
                            Dusty boxes. Old, broken things. Moth-eaten outerwear. Yeah, just how I figured an attic in an abandoned house would look. <br>
                            I've always been a sceptic when it comes to the unknown, but I don't like it up here. It feels like I'm being watched. Atleast I have my axe. <br>
                            <br>
                            ...What was that sound? Maybe just rats.

                            <br>
                            Just stepping into the basement again is hard. I feel like I spent too long in this room but there must be something here I need. <br>
                            I mean more than an axe. Not that the axe hasn't been of any help, the least it has done is made me feel somewhat protected. <br>
                            <br>
                            That chest over there seems important, but do I have all the clues that the note taunted me about?
