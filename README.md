# Description:

"You've been poisoned, you're objective is to find the antidote as soon as possible."

This is an text-based puzzle experience in which you type commands into a parser in order to progress forward. 
Look at all the items and find all the clues you need in order to come out as a winner!

**The game is meant to be played on a 1920x1080 resolution and isn't optimized for other resolutions, such as tablet or mobile.**

The reason why is because the game is meant to be played with a keyboard and therefore the focus has been on optimizing the experience on a 1920x1080 resolution, which a large margin of laptops and desktops have access to.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
